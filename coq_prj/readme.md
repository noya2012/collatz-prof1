Here's a summary of our major completed proofs:
Basic Operation Validity
Proved completeness of binary combinations (binary_combination_completeness)
Proved completeness of ternary combinations (collatz_ternary_composition)
Proved preservation of sequence operation validity (sequence_validity_preservation)
2. R0 Operation Dominance
Proved R0 operation count dominance (R0_dominance_by_chains): R0 operations outnumber R1 operations
Proved stronger R0 dominance (R0_dominance_by_ternary): R0 count is at least double R1 count
Proved R0 count grows with length (R0_count_grows_with_length)
Properties of Three Basic Patterns
Properties and upper bounds of R0R1 pattern (R0R1_pattern_bound)
Properties and upper bounds of R1R0 pattern
Special properties of R0R0 pattern (R0R0_special_properties)
Relationship between three patterns (pattern_value_comparison)
Growth Rates and Upper Bounds
Proved growth rate theorems for all three patterns (R0R1_growth_rate, R1R0_growth_rate, R0R0_growth_rate)
Proved unified upper bound for combined sequences (combined_sequence_bound_optimized)
Proved pattern value upper bounds (pattern_upper_bound)
Continuity and Validity
Proved continuity of three binary patterns
Proved continuity of combined patterns (combined_pattern_continuity)
Proved preservation of sequence validity (sequence_validity_preservation)
These proofs establish crucial foundational properties for building a proof framework for the Collatz conjecture. Particularly significant is the proof of R0 operation dominance, which is key to proving that sequences eventually descend to 1.
